## General Information
Project background - CodePro is an EdTech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round and utilised the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business. The major cost that the company is incurring is the customer acquisition cost (CAC).At the initial stage, customer acquisition cost is required to be high, but as their businesses grow, it needs to start focussing on profitability. hence, the company needs to identify the customer leads, so they can focus their energy/attention to the users who have high chance of subscription.
